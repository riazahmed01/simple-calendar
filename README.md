# Simple calender using ASM

For this assignment we were tasked in making a calendar using assembly language. I made 2021 calander and I allow user input.
For my code, the w button goes forward and q button goes back. In addition, a allows you to skip to the start of the year and
s allows you to skip to the end of the year at any position. I have a instruction and end screen as well. I had difficulty
with adding colors to the calender. When I did add color, I was not able to revert the colors back to the original and the
color remained in the instruction and end screen. So I decided to add color to all screen.

Time spent: **23** hours spent in total

## User Functions

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can navigate the calender.
- [x] User can jump to the starting month of the year.
- [x] User can jump to the ending month of the year.
